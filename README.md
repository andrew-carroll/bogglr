# Bogglr

This is a social network for rat owners and enthusiasts. It is currently in development and will eventually include features such as a veterinary database, comments, photos, and more.

## Installation

To use this social network, you will need to have Ruby and Rails installed on your system. You can install Ruby using a version manager such as RVM or rbenv, and Rails can be installed using the following command:

```ruby
gem install rails
```

Once Rails is installed, clone this repository to your local machine and run the following commands to set up the database:

```bash
bundle install
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails server
```
